# 簡介

### 歡迎

歡迎來到從下而上的電腦科學。本書翻譯自 Ian Wienand 的 Computer Science from the Bottom Up。

#### Philosophy

In a nutshell, what you are reading is intended to be a shop class for computer science. Young computer science students are taught to "drive" the computer; but where do you go to learn what is under the hood? Trying to understand the operating system is unfortunately not as easy as just opening the bonnet. The current Linux kernel runs into the millions of lines of code, add to that the other critical parts of a modern operating system (the compiler, assembler and system libraries) and your code base becomes unimaginable. Further still, add a University level operating systems course (or four), some good reference manuals, two or three years of C experience and, just maybe, you might be able to figure out where to _start looking_ to make sense of it all.

To keep with the car analogy, the prospective student is starting out trying to work on a Formula One engine without ever knowing how a two stroke motor operates. During their shop class the student should pull apart, twist, turn and put back together that two stroke motor, and consequentially have a pretty good framework for understanding just how the Formula One engine works. Nobody will expect them to be a Formula One engineer, but they are well on their way!

#### 為什麼要從下而上學習

不是每個人都願意參加手工藝課程，從無到有的創造出東西。大多數的人只想要開車，不會想要憑空做出一台車。而一般的程式課程也考慮到了這點，所以大致上的電腦科學都是「由上而下」的教學：從應用程式，高級語言，軟體設計，開發原理，資料結構。或許可能會學一些簡單不深入的二進位，二進位邏輯，或是更底層的一些概念與知識，如暫存器(Register)、CPU指令(opcodes)。

本書的目標就是完全跟剛剛所說的方向相反的教學，從作業系統基礎講到應用程式是如何被編譯與執行



#### Enabling Technologies

This book is only possible thanks to the development of [Open Source](https://www.bottomupcs.com/gloss01.html#opensource) technologies. Before Linux it was like taking a shop course with a car that had its bonnet welded shut; today we are in a position to open that bonnet, poke around with the insides and, better still, take that engine and use it to do whatever we want.
